With the current global pandemic, food delivery slots are difficult to get and advice is to reduce food-shopping trips as much as possible. So I've been trying to make the ingredients I do have stretch as far as possible for meals and avoid any food waste! In this post I've put together some of the recipes I've used over the past few weeks which I thought were good meals for using up ingredients.


Miso-tahini tempeh and aubergine rice:

I recently have got into using tempeh which is feremented tofu. It's so good! I used a tofoo one in this meal. 1 pack which cost Â£3 does 4 servings!  Miso and tahini are two flavours that go so well together so thought I'd try combining it with the tempeh and some other ingredients I needed to use up. I fried an onion, half an aubergine, half a tempeh block, a carrot, 2 garlic cloves and 1 cm of ginger (all diced) in sesame oil. Then I added a couple of big teaspoons of miso and tahini and cooked it down for a while on a fairly high heat (the flavour is better when the aubergine and tempeh crisp up a bit). Meanwhile I cooked some brown rice in a saucepan (white rice would work well too, if not better, as it would be nice and fluffy). It's a good idea to put the brown rice on before frying the veg as it takes longer to cook. Add the cooked rice to the veg along with a sprinkle of frozen peas and a couple of handfuls of spinach. Once the spinach has wilted and the peas defrosted, it's ready to serve.

Medditeranean vegetable orzo:
This was inspired by a recipe from Miguel's one pound vegan meals book. 
This is a great one pot meal because the orzo pasta doesn't have to be cooked separately as it's so small.
Chargrill some red pepper slices on a hot dry pan, then add some oil. I had some leftover cooked veg (courgettes, mushroom, onion) which I added to the pan with a tin of tomatoes and some orzo (120g for 2). Serve when the orzo is cooked. I added some vegan parmesan and seeds on top.

Laksa:
This was another recipe inspired by one pound vegan meals. 
It uses a small chunk of cabbage per person and half a can of coconut milk. This was really good when I didn't have a lot of food in the house and was trying to use up what I had. This cabbage lasted over a lot of meals.
I served it with noodles to add some carbs.

Sweet potato groundnut stew:
This recipe is from the green roasting tin recipe book. It uses onion and sweet potato, a tin of tomatoes, peanut butter and veg stock and tastes really good. I added a ball of frozen spinach because I didn't have any coriander to go on top.

Lentil spaghetti bolognaise:
This was a really quick meal using mainly store-cupboard ingredintsHere I fried some onions, garlic and added a pack of black lentils, a tin of tomatoes and cooked it down while I boiled some wholewheat. I added some marmite and soy sauce and it actually gave it a really nice flavour! I added some vegan parmesan.

Ramen:
Ramen is a really nice meal which is filling, yummy and works well with fewer ingredients or more if you want to use up some veg.
Fry some miso paste with garlic, ginger, chinese 5 spice and chilli flakes before adding some vegetable stock. Let this simmer for 10 mins or so. Meanwhile, fry some toppings. Some tofu or tempeh fried in sesame oil works well. I also like fried mushrooms or cabbage. Whatever topping you do - some chinese 5 spice and soy sauce work well as flavourings. Don't forget to cook some noodles to go in the ramen to, you could do this separately or in the ramen stock. Once the noodles are cooked, spoon the stock/noodles into bowls first, followed by the toppings. You could also finish with some spring onions and sesame seeds if you have them.

Lunch at home:

Fried tahini mushrooms and tomato on sourdough toast:
One of my favourite lunchtime meals is fried tomatoes and mushrooms on toast (made from my own sourdough), topped with tahini and seeds. A small handful of tomatoes and a couple of mushrooms is enough for one person :)

Avocado and salad on toast: 
Some vegan feta on top of this would have been great but I ran out. It's still really good without!
