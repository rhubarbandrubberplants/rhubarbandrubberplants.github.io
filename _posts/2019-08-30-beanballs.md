I made cannellini bean balls and mash with onion gravy (for two)- another recipe
from Miguel Barclay's [vegan one pound meals](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vegan-Pound-Meals-Miguel-Barclay/dp/1472263723). It's good because I'm finding that
I often have already the ingredients to do a lot of the recipes
This recipe was a bit more effort than usual but well worth it!

Ingredients:
* potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
* diced onion
* tin of cannellini beans
* plain flour
* dried oregano
* broccoli
* olive oil

For the bean balls:
Fry the onion, garlic and dried oregano until soft in some olive oil, then add
the tin of cannellini beans with half the water from the tin too. Fry off the
liquid (this took about 10 mins), then take of the heat, push into a bowl and mash with a fork.
Leave to cool and then add a couple of tablespoons of plain flour. Mix together
and then use a spoon or/and hands to make into balls (should be table tennis
ball size). Then fry until golden on all sides!

For the mash:
Boil the potatoes until soft. Then drain and mash with olive oil. Then season
with salt and pepper. I would usually put in milk and butter but I thought I'd
try using only olive oil to keep the meal vegan.

I served the bean balls and mash together with broccoli and onion gravy (which
I made from a gravy powder).

Tip: I don't know if it's because I didn't cook the liquid off enough first, but quite
a bit of flour was needed to make the bean balls - more than what the recipe said.

Overall it was a really nice meal! I might try adding different spices/herbs or veg to
the bean balls to change the flavouring just for fun but otherwise I will make
this recipe again for sure. It's an easy way of making 'meatballs' which are
veggie/vegan and doesn't require that much washing up; usually this kind of
recipe uses a blender or food processor which takes a bit more time to wash up.
Also I really liked the vegan mash - it was much lighter than buttery mash and
the flavour of the olive oil comes through quite a lot. Not a bad vegan alternative
if you're looking for one!
