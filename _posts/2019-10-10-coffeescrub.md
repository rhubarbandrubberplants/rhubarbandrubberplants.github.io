Thought I'd try making a body scrub made out of used coffee grounds. I drink coffee quite a few times a day often using instant but occasionally I like to make myself one with freshly ground beans and an aeropress! I saw a post on instagram about reusing coffee grounds for a coffee srub so thought I'd give it a try. I used to buy body scrubs a lot and they can be really expensive, but doing it this way is cheap as chips as I would be throwing away the the main ingredient usually (in the food waste) so essentially it's free!

I mixed together some coffee grounds that I let dry off for a day after using with some coconut oil and sugar.

I am yet to try it out - will let you know whether it works well!
