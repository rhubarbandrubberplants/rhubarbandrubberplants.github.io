Thought I'd try making some Kimchi as it sounds fairly simple!
For those who don't know, kimchi is cabbage fermented in salt and flavourings such as chilli, garlic and ginger. 
The three primary ingredients are cabbage (traditionally napa), salt and korean chilli pepper flakes (Gochugaru).

Getting hold of a napa cabbage was not easy for me so I went for a chinese cabbage instead (not sure if they are actually the same thing?)
I have a massive jar of salt in my cupboard already so I didn't need to buy any of this.
In most Kimchi recipes, korean pepper flakes are essential to kimchi! However I couldn't find any of these in any supermarkets (online and in store). However I did find a Gochujang paste in Waitrose so thought I'd try this as it seemed to be the closest thing I could get hold of!

The basic method for making a kimchi is to salt the cabbage and leave it to absorb for a while. Then you make a paste out of ingredients like chilli, ginger and garlic. I've seen recipes with more ingredients such as shrimp paste, fish sauce (which you can omit if you want a vegan kimchi like me!), sugar, soy sauce but the core flavourings tend to be the chilli, ginger and garlic. You can also add more veg such as radishes (daikon or normal salad ones), carrot or spring onions.

I sadly forgot to buy some ginger when I made my kimchi so I didn't include this in my paste! Thought I better make it before the cabbage went off. Overall the recipe I followed is a very quick and basic one, based off of the quick kimchi recipe on bbc goodfood.

Here's the ingredients I used: 
* 1 chinese cabbage
* 1 tablespoon of salt
* 7 teaspoons of chilli paste
* 4 garlic gloves
* 3 small carrots
* 4 or 5 spring onions


Method:
1) Wash the chinese cabbage and cute into quarters. Then cut each quarter into strips.
2) Sprinkle the salt over the cabbage and leave for 1hr.
3) Meanwhile, chop up the carrots into matchsticks and slice the spring onions.
4) After an hour, rinse the cabbage and dry.
5) Put the cabbage into a bowl with the spring onion and carrots. 
6) Then grate the garlic on top and add the chilli. 
7) Mix together until the cabbage is coated evenly,
8) Fill up some sterilised jars with the kimchi and leave to ferment overnight in a cool dark place such as a cupboard.
9) After that, keep in the fridge or eat! Apparently it should last for up to 2 weeks! 

Will let you know it tastes!
